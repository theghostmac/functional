# Chapter One
## Notes on Go
Go is multi-paradigm; it has:
- functions as first-class citizens
- higher-order functions
- immutability guarantees
- generics (not needed but makes life easier)
- recursion.
From v1.18, Go introduced:
- tail-call optimization
- lazy evaluation
- purity guarantee.

## Notes on FP
FP is:
- Not the best paradigm
- more readable, easier to understand and debug
- easier to write tests for
- almost bug-free
- easy for concurrency
- against side effects
- declarative
- recursive.
